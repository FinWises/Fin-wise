                         A stock market is a place where people buy and sell ownership in companies. When you buy a share of a company's stock, you become a part owner of that company, and you can potentially make money if the company does well and the value of its stock goes up. The stock market is where these transactions take place, and it allows people to invest in companies and potentially earn a return on their investment. <br>

                        A stock, or share, is a unit of ownership in a company. When a company issues stocks to the public, people can buy those stocks to become partial owners of the company. Owning stocks gives investors a chance to share in the company's profits and assets. The price of a stock can go up or down based on how well the company is performing and other economic factors. <br>
